### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With almost 18 years of professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of programming languages, including C# .Net, Delphi, Python, Assembly, Visual Basic, C++, C, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, ASP, PHP, SQL, and more.

I've always had a special love for languages and cultures i come from the Faroe Islands and speak natively English, Danish & Faroese, other languages i speak include Swedish and Norwegian,
and currently learning Japanese & French

Personal projects include: Compiler Technology (CIL & AsmGen x86), with my own Operating System with a hybrid kernel (probably not the best one to be honest), wrote a Network Engine for a MMO company in Canada to increase their CCU base clients. Plus an AI engine that was designed for Game Development but has been reported to be used in College Robotics Projects. ( fun to see people using your technology in unexpected ways )

Researching Machine Learning Algorythms and Network technologies, with a special interest in plug 'n play architectural designs.

Honorable projects include being assigned as the Architect and Lead Software Engineer, responsible for setting up and handling the national IT infrastructure of the Covid-19 pandemic, creating the national Covid Test Centers and Vaccination Centers, along with the Faroese EU DCC (European Union's Digital Corona Certificate) implementation. (aka KoronaPass)
